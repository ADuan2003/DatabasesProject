DD = dropdown

Find: 
    DD(aggregate functions)          DD(aggregate functions)
    DD(employee, project, etc.) with DD(attribute)           by DD(groupable attributes)
Dynamic UI where selecting the entity you wanna find (ex. employee, project, etc.) allows for filtering by different attributes? 
How will aggregate functions work? Since they can be applied to both the "find" and the "attribute"...

Show all: 
    DD(employees, projects, etc.) with DD(attribute) DD(comparisons ex. =, <, contains) Textbox(filter)
Or should these be buttons? Ex. "show all employees" is a button (which then gives a dropdown of possible filters?)
